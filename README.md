# win-ls
ls program for windows written in python and run as batch file.

## ls
ls command returns the list of files and directories in the current directory.
My addition are -
1. the command also returns the number of files and directories and not only lists of them.
2. the command can return data about another directory and not only the current one.  

## My program
The program is the ls command that is in Linux os, that can used in windows.
The program can get argument for the directory the user want to run ls in, if the user does not enter a path the user sets the current directory as path.
